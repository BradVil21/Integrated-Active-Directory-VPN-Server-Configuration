# Integrated Active Directory VPN Server Configuration

**Introduction:** _In this project, I demonstrate my ability to configure, secure, and integrate a VPN solution with Active Directory on a Windows Server 2019 environment. The tasks include setting up a VPN server for secure remote access, configuring the Netgear Orbi router to forward traffic, and ensuring seamless communication between external clients and internal resources. The project highlights my skills in managing network services, ensuring proper connectivity, and maintaining a secure infrastructure for both internal and remote communication through Active Directory-based authentication._

Throughout this project, I'll gain hands-on experience with the following concepts and skills:

* Windows Server 2019 (RRAS, Active Directory)
* Netgear Orbi Router (VPN configuration & port forwarding)
* VPN Protocols: PPTP, L2TP, and SSTP
* Active Directory Authentication

# Step 1:  Set Up a VPN Server on Your Windows Server 2019 (RRAS)
I will start by installing remote access role through the roles and features within my Server Manager and selecting an L2TP VPN access during my configuration.
